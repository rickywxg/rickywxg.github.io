## Welcome to Ricky Wang's GitHub Pages

One can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/rickywxg/rickywxg.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for the website in Markdown files.

Whenever a commit is merged to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in the site, from the content in the Markdown files.
